# Microsoft-Professional-Program-Data-Science
Github repo for showing the code to create some of the visualizations I used for the
Microsoft Professional Programm Data Science final project

# Data
all data required is in the /data subfolder.

# notebook
the ipython notebook 'Charts MS PP Data Science.ipynb' includes the snippets out
of my code base that are required to re-create the visualizations.

# note:
This is only a very small fraction of the work that I put into the final project.
In all I created hundreds of machine learning models during parameter tuning, spread
across experimentation with different model types and three distinct approaches at the data.

# report:
For completeness, I have included the report I created and which summarizes my findings
on this particular dataset.
